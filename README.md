# Omnifood

Omnifood is a responsive website that  was created as a part of an online course in
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/). The idea was to imagine that a company hired me and to design
a webpage based on the [information](./content.md) given.
